This is not a typical technical post. This is an attempt to restart the process, and start it over, in some sense.
A lot has been happening for the last 6 months - a new startup joined (10+/7, surely not 24/7 :), a baby was born, lots of thinking about the future. The way I would like to work, the place I would like to be, the life I would like to live.

And obviously very very little of a free time for anything outside of the family or work.

### Small steps, but daily

So, considering the huge backlog of things to do at work, the new responsibility at home, and continuously growing list of "things would like to work, build, learn, try, read, share, etc.", it looks like there will be no other way to achieve all of this, or find a time to do it, until I actually start doing it. Everyday, consistently. 

Might not be perfect. Might not be huge. But it will help me keep my inner fire and motivation going. And this is the only way to keep the pace with the things I am busy with. And it is better to make things, rather than make them perfect, and so never release.

Also, I found that the best decisions or work has been done when the distance (i.e. time) between the idea/new knowledge and its implementation was the minimum, from a few hours up to max one day.

And this is one of the reason why daily progress is important.

And for any thing I start there are usually lots of things to do and learn on the way, lots of unknowns, and if it might look like impossible to grasp all at once, and so paralyze to even start, doing smaller steps daily eventually conquers the fear and helps things happen.

### There is always something to share everyday

I found myself many times in the end of the working day, or even during the rest, that there is always something to share. My job gives me the opportunity not to only apply my current skills, and serve the people I work with, but also to learn and to grow, which I am very grateful for. 

Specially, nowadays, when working in a small team in ambitious startup, and where we have to explore the new territory daily, technically as well, it gives lots of energy to move forward.

### What will be the theme?

Well, there will not be one single area I will devote all the posts to, but instead will focus on everything I am currently busy, thinking of, or doing. Although, there are topics which I am interested more than others.

In a sense, the theme can be exactly what blog is about "Practice of programming (daily)".

Stay tuned! :)
