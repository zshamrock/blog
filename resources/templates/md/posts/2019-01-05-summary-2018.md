Here is the summary of the 2018 year from the technical perspective.

### Tool(s) of the year
- [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/) window manager
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)

_Initially Enlightenment was the only one candidate, but in the end of the year I have discovered f.lux, and it immediately has been promoted into the "Tools of the year"_.

### Language of the year
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

### Conference of the year
- [HighLoad++](http://www.highload.ru/moscow/2018/) in Moscow

_Although being honest I have attended only 2: [Joker](https://jokerconf.com/) in Saint Petersburg and [HighLoad++](http://www.highload.ru/moscow/2018/) in Moscow/Skolkovo_.

### Library of the year
- [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)

### Commitment of the year

Since February, 1st I have set the commitment to start working on my open source projects (either active or in the idea phase only) every day. So there should be the commit/activity every single day in the GitHub contributions track:

There are 4 main projects I have been working through the past year:
- vmx
- uuidfmt
- dynosql
- dynoman

All of them came out of the necessity, i.e. they were built to help me (and the team) to work on my day to day development activities on the main project.

## vmx

Description: Remote instances management tool over SSH written in Go
Lang: Go
Status: Ready to use

This tool is used in the project to do dev and prod deployments, plus various handy commands to run against specific set of servers.

Likely, I think, there could be other tools available for doing similar tasks. And even all our infrastructure is automated using Ansible, there is still a place for the vmx tool. At least currently we are running 3 dev EC2 instances, and about 21 prod EC2 instances, and vmx does the job well, and I am not looking for other tools.

Ultimate next step would be to introduce Kubernetes to project, as we run all the services as the Docker containers, but in the current stage Kubernetes would not bring any technical or business value to the project.

## uuidfmt

Description:
Lang: Go
Status: Ready to use

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/uuidfmt)

This tool was written to mainly convert between 2 different formats of UUID-s. One format is used in the MySQL, and another format is used in the DynamoDB (and these are the primary keys in the tables), so it was cumbersome to do the conversion manually. And the tool was born.

viz and snap

I am glad that other people also found the tool useful, not many, but still.


## dynosql
Description:
Lang: Java
Status: In development

The idea was to implement SQL parser and to transform from SQL to the corresponding DynamoDB query/scan. There are no really good libraries for this in the Java ecosystem available. There is similar library in Python with its own defined like SQL language. And also RazorSQL provides support for running SQL queries against DynamoDB. (provide both links to the pages)

I have run multiple stages in the implementation, from trying to build the parser using ANTLR and the available ANTLR grammar. It did not work well.
Was trying to use any of the available libraries for parsing SQL query. Also none of them really fit my need. So finally, as in the first stage the support is only limited to the SELECT statements, and they will be extended by the syntax similar to the DQL, I do parsing of the query myself.

The goal is to use this library as the dependency for the *dynoman*, but also could be used standalone, so this is why was extracted into the separate project.

## dynoman

Description:
Lang: Kotlin
Status: Ready to use

Actually this project was the main focus of the year, and the time I spent mostly on.

Again was built for the necessity to use more convenient and feature rich tool to work with DynamoDB rather than official web UI/console. Actually the UI is modelled after the web UI, but with some extended features I was missing.

Proved to work fine, as in 80% of the cases (the more I progress, the more cases it covers) I use this tool instead of the web UI.

Also it was the nice opportunity to practice Kotlin, and look into the modern Java desktop development (I had good experience in the past working with Swing in my student years). And really enjoy building desktop apps.

### Plans for 2019

What I am sure I will continue doing is to work on my open source projects:
- provide good solid documentation for the vmx
- complete dynosql to be able parse DQL and produce the corresponding DynamoDB query
- deliver the dynoman to the stage with the core features I am aiming for
- provide the various distribution formats for the dynoman to be installed on Mac, Linux and Windows

Also will explore Kotlin more.

Other things are more nice to do, like exploring Clickhous and Tarantool (again from the perspective to use them in the project), but the above is already a lot, considering I do them in my free time, and have the full time job with lots of challenges.
