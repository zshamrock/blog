Decisions done in the morning or when not tired tend to be the better one, as well as the more will power allows to dig deeper into the unknown areas.

TODO: Include the image of the 3 months continuos commit history from the GitHub, and 2 released projects: vmx and dynosql!

And start the work on the dynoman already!

On the February, 1st for various reasons I've made the decision to make the commitment to commit into the GitHub every day at least for the next 3 months (but moving forward, this is kind of the habit right now). Here I would like to share the experience of doing this already for the last 3 months, some thoughts and feelings while building this routine.

### Perfection

One of obstacle I usually face (and this practice if not helped to overcome it, but it at least made it less negative) is the aim for the perfection.

There are 2 different aspects of the perfection obstacle:

1. waiting for the perfect time and for all decisions to be made up-front
2. waiting for the perfect skills

And both of them are solve by doing the commitment. One thing to note that doing open source projects on the GitHub is the activity outside of my main work, and so done outside of the working hours. Also because the nature of the start-up I am working on, neither good or bad, but I am really employed 24/7, spending all the available [1] time working on the project.

What this really means is by having the commitment to commit every day to my open source projects, which also means that I do have find the time to think about them, and actually write the real code there, the lack of the time forces to make quick decisions, and do something which eventually gets improved over the iterations, and clarify the requirements on the way when getting feedback from the actual usage of the tools, and not by some ephemeral set of features, which is not clear how valuable they actually will be.

Also based on the nature of the open source projects I am working right now they require using languages and frameworks/tools I am not very familiar, i.e. something I don't use daily at work. Which forces to start coding without in-depth knowledge of the language or framework, and improve as soon as more and more learn about these tools.

For, example, vmx project. I do know Go. But, because, I do write on it occasionally, I have to refresh the skills every time I start coding on Go. I might not know the right ways of doing things in Go. But I do at least something, which works and brings value. And as soon as I learn the better way of doing something in Go, I revisit the code and update it accordingly.

### Finding the time

T found the most productive time work on the open source projects is the morning, although in my case this is not the option for most of the days apart from the weekends. So about 90% of the time I work in the evenings. The interesting thing is that will power has its own capacity. You start with the full 100% capacity in the morning, and during the day you slowly consume your will power for various tasks and decisions. And in the evening sometimes it is so difficult to go extra mile just on the will power only. You need another source of the energy to keep going. For me this is the "Why Power". Without "why power" I would have probably failed already.

Because of the "why power" I wake at 11pm, or close to the midnight if I got asleep after difficult day in the evening, and have to do something, even the smallest possible thing, but do it, and don't skip the day. It is difficult. Really difficult. I have to do this while traveling, searching for the internet connection, and do the coding in the hotel room in the evening after the long trip.

### Cheat codes

Have I cheated? Yes, sometimes I have to split commits, when I know that in the upcoming day I would have time only actually for doing the commit and not writing the actual code. So I do extra work on the previous day, but commit this work only the next day.

Sometimes the only thing I do is to clarify the requirements and create the corresponding tickets in the GitHub Issues for the project, which luckily also counts for the contribution. Which makes sense. As working on the project doesn't mean exclusively coding.

### Good design

Even though there could be lack of time and knowledge it doesn't (and should not mean) the bad design is in place or no thinking up-front. The good software design principles are universal, no matter which language or tool is used. Same for the thinking. It is not necessary to know all the answers up-front, it is good enough to have the clear answers for the next one or two iterations.

### Iterations

Make it work, make it right, make it fast!

Also over time the new more clear and specific requirements/features crystallize by using the tool, or being inspired by something new encountered.

### Challenge

When the only you have only couple of minutes each day, or at most hour, it takes time to come back to the focus, and resume the work which has been left. Specifically this is the challenge when using the different lang/tech different from the main used at work. And even more this is the challenge when using the different lang/tech and resume the work on the project which you have not touched for weeks. So it is all about the focus and flow, which requires time and energy. 

****

So, in summary this was the good and rewarding experience, and I will continue doing this, and see where this path directs me. At least I hope by the end of the year I would have a few completed projects, at least used by myself, maybe inside the company or hopefully by the other people outside of my circle.

Let's distinguish here available and free time. I am not a workaholic, although people from the outside could think like this. I do like "Quantity of the time at work, and quality of the time at home". I do travel, read books, watch movies, spend time with my family and the kid, but whenever possible the rest of the time I do work on the project.
